- insertion is work by incremental method 

>[!NOTE]
> 1- there is another method that call divide and concer the worth case in it less than the insertion sort 
> 2- the second advantage is the the analizing its runing time is easy 


#  The divide-and-conquer method

```md
they break the problem into several
subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size
and combine it in one sorted array 
```

_**the base case—you just solve it directly without recursing**_

## the recursive case—you perform three characteristic steps
>1- Divide the problem into one or more subproblems that are smaller
>instances of the same problem
>2- Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively.
>3- Combine the subproblem solutions to form a solution to the original problem.


- merge sort use this method 
  by the same 3 steps you can saw it in the book
